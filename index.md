### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I liked lab 3 because in part 2, we were able to use functions to
    calculate the date difference between two different days using functions.
    This lab taught me a lot about how to write functions and how to access
    them in main. Also, this lab gave me an idea of why functions are so
    important when coding. I thought the formula used to find the date
    difference was interesting.

* Lab 7

    I liked lab 7 because we had to use multiple if and else ifs to determine
    whether you could park on a particular street. I learned a lot about using
    if and else ifs since we had to write many conditions for each of the streets.
    Also, using the and/or operator to write multiple conditions for the ifs
    and else ifs were helpful.

* Lab 8

    I liked lab 8 because we had to use a combination of functions, for loops,
    and ifs to find the average between 5 scores. This lab taught me how to use
    the two different types of for loops and when to use each one. Also, we learned
    how to use nested for loops for part 2 to create a pattern which was cool.
